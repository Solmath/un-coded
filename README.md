# Un-Coded: A Software Development MTG Parody Set

Welcome to **Un-Coded**, a whimsical, tongue-in-cheek *Magic: The Gathering* set inspired by the world of software development! Drawing on the spirit of the classic Un-sets, Un-Coded reimagines the coding life — its chaos, creativity, and caffeine-fueled camaraderie—through clever mechanics and hilarious card designs. Whether you’re a developer, a gamer, or just love a good in-joke, this set is packed with references, puns, and playful twists on both programming and MTG traditions.

Below you'll find a list of cards, mechanics, and tokens that bring the drama of the dev cycle to the battlefield. Ship code, squash bugs, and maybe — just maybe — win by deploying bug-free code!

## General Information

Each color (and artifacts) has a distinct "take" on the coding theme:

**White** = teamwork & structure  
**Blue** = architecture, overengineering, control  
**Black** = tech debt, darkness of bugs  
**Red** = chaos, feature creep, pivots  
**Green** = growth, pair programming, natural synergy  
**Artifacts** = tooling & platforms

## Core Mechanics

**Code tokens** - Artifact tokens that can have bug counters  
**Bug counters** - Negative markers that prevent Code tokens from being "bug-free"  
**Ship It** - Win condition: Control 10+ bug-free Code tokens  
**Affinity for Code** - Spells cost {1} less for each bug-free Code token you control

## Creatures
