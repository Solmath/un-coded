# Un-Coded

## General information

Each color (and artifacts) has a distinct “take” on the coding theme:

White = teamwork & structure

Blue = architecture, overengineering, control

Black = tech debt, darkness of bugs

Red = chaos, feature creep, pivots

Green = growth, pair programming, natural synergy

Artifacts = tooling & platforms

## Creatures

### Senior Software Developer
